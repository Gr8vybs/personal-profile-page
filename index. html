    Mini Project: Personal Profile Page (HTML Only)
    Objective: The goal of this project is to create a personal profile webpage using only HTML. 
    This exercise tests the ability to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements.
    -->
    <!-- 
    Use Case:
    This project, "Personal Profile Page," is designed as an HTML-only mini project to practice the use of semantic HTML elements.
    The use case includes:
    1. Structuring a webpage with proper semantic tags such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>.
    2. Creating a simple profile webpage that introduces a user and lists their hobbies and contact information.
    3. Demonstrating foundational HTML skills for beginner-level web development, which can be built upon with CSS and JavaScript in future projects.
    4. Preparing a practical example for learning, practice, or inclusion in a coding portfolio.
